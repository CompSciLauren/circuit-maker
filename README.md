# circuit-maker
> An online GUI for demonstrating binary logic gates

**User Instructions**
1. Go to circuit-maker.compscilauren.com
    - There are buttons on the upper left corner of the screen. The buttons read as "T", "F", "And Gate", "Or Gate", "Connector", and "Output".
    - There is a large, empty white space covering most of the screen. When you click on any of the buttons, everything will happen within the white space below the buttons, and you can drag any objects across the empty space.
2. Click on the "T", "F", and "And/Or Gate" buttons as many times as needed to set up the gates you would like to test. Drag and drop them so you will be able to connect them with the Connector objects, which are obtained by clicking the "Connector" button.
3. Click and drag the Connector objects so that each one has a "T" or "F" variable on the left, and an "And" or "Or" Gate on the right. Once a Connector is connected to the other objects, you cannot disconnect them unless you refresh the page.
4. When ready to see the results, click on the "Output" button.

**Features/Appearance**
+ Drag and drop
+ Buttons to click to create interactive objects on the screen
+ Each object has a unique function or meaning, and when combined will affect the output
+ Button to click when finished with design, to compute logic
+ Input logic first and get an output of the graphical logic gates

**Features/Appearance for Next Update**
+ Save designs in files and upload files for editing
+ Ability to delete objects on screen
+ Ability to disconnect objects after they have been connected
+ Ability to show Output when combining multiple gates together
+ Tutorial and quick lesson on boolean logic gates with link to learn more

**Code**
+ Code to create the drag and drop environment
+ Function to perform calculations (after logic or graphic building)
+ Function for the buttons (compute logic, save design, upload design, tutorial)
+ Beginner-friendly tutorial (mostly writing in English and printing out to screen)

**Analysis**

*Things I will need to learn:*
+ Review boolean logic gates
+ JavaScript

*Possible issues that will arise:*
+ Creating the drag and drop environment, something I haven't done before
+ Environment not being user-friendly; user can drag and drop but make it look jumbled and confusing
+ Figuring out most efficient and logical way to connect the objects together

**Project Progress**
+ Step One: Planning & Design
+ Step Two: Implement Logic Code & Testing
+ Step Three: Implement Graphical Code & Testing

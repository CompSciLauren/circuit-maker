> An online GUI for demonstrating binary logic gates

**Features/Appearance**
+ Drag and drop
+ Button to click when finished with design, to compute logic
+ Save designs in files and upload files for editing
+ Input logic first and get an output of the graphical logic gates
+ Tutorial and quick lesson on boolean logic gates with link to learn more

**Code**
+ Code to create the drag and drop environment
+ Function to perform calculations (after logic or graphic building)
+ Function for the buttons (compute logic, save design, upload design, tutorial)
+ Beginner-friendly tutorial (mostly writing in English and printing out to screen)

**Analysis**
*Things I will need to learn:*
+ Review boolean logic gates
+ JavaScript

*Possible issues that will arise:*
+ Creating the drag and drop environment, something I haven't done before
+ Environment not being user-friendly; user can drag and drop but make it look jumbled and confusing

**Project Progress**

* Step One: Planning & Design
* Step Two: Implement Logic Code & Testing
* Step Three: Implement Graphical Code & Testing

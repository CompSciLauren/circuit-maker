## User Instructions
1. Go to circuit-maker.compscilauren.com
    - There are buttons on the upper left corner of the screen. The buttons read as "T", "F", "And Gate", "Or Gate", "Connector", and "Output".
    - There is a large, empty white space covering most of the screen. When you click on any of the buttons, everything will happen within the white space below the buttons, and you can drag any objects across the empty space.
2. Click on the "T", "F", and "And/Or Gate" buttons as many times as needed to set up the gates you would like to test. Drag and drop them so you will be able to connect them with the Connector objects, which are obtained by clicking the "Connector" button.
3. Click and drag the Connector objects so that each one has a "T" or "F" variable on the left, and an "And" or "Or" Gate on the right. Once a Connector is connected to the other objects, you cannot disconnect them unless you refresh the page.
4. When ready to see the results, click on the "Output" button.
